          King's Hand. Eddard reluctantly agrees after learning of a possible threat to the King's life. Eddard's bastard son Jon
          Snow must make a painful decision about his own future, while in the distant east Viserys Targaryen plots to reclaim his
          father's throne, usurped by Robert, by selling his sister in marriage.</p>
